# MovieSearch
Movie Search Tech Test

This is a techical takehome project which accesses the OMDB API to search for movies and then save the results. 

The application uses the following technologies to create a simplistic user experience which allows a user to enter a search parameter and view the results in either a portrait or landscape orientation, save the a result for later viewing or re search a recently successful search paramter. The application data is persisted between app restarts and works on both iPhone and iPad. The application has been constructed with the thought process that another developer would be able to work on it with minimal effort bar a small learning curve. 

Architecture:

The app arichetecture is built on the coordinator pattern using MVC. It utilises storyboard while the UI is built programatically.
